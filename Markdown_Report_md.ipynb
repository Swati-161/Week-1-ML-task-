        "## Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
        "   - Handled missing values by filling them with the median.\n",
        "   - Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "   - Applied **log transformation** to the `Amount` feature to handle outliers.\n",
        "   - Scaled features like `Log_Amount` and `Time` using **StandardScaler**.\n",
        "   - Applied **SMOTE** to balance the class distribution between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "   - Created new features like `Log_Amount` and `Log_Amount_Time_interaction` to provide better insights.\n",
        "   - Calculated VIF to address multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Training**:\n",
        "   - Used **Logistic Regression** due to its simplicity for binary classification problems.\n",
        "   - Trained the model on the resampled dataset (after SMOTE).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "Several challenges were encountered during the course of the project:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Imbalance**:\n",
        "   - The dataset had a highly imbalanced distribution between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. This could lead to poor performance of the model, as it may bias predictions toward the majority class.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
        "   - Scaling features like `Amount` and `Time` was essential to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model. Otherwise, the model could give more weight to higher-value features, which would be detrimental.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Model Convergence Warning**:\n",
        "   - The Logistic Regression model initially faced convergence issues during training due to the large number of iterations required for the solver to find an optimal solution.\n",
        "   \n",
        "## Results\n",
        "\n",
        "The Logistic Regression model performed well, achieving the following metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: 98%\n",
        "- **Precision (Fraud Class)**: 99%\n",
        "- **Recall (Fraud Class)**: 97%\n",
        "- **F1-score**: 98%\n",
        "\n",
